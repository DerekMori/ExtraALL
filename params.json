{"name":"Extraall","tagline":"ExtraALL","body":"### Welcome to ExtraALL Page.\r\nHello I am Nitralow creator and maintainer of ExtraALL\r\nExtraALL is an Idea I had well in my past time to learn some java code. Yes, before starting this I had to knowledge of java or any other language but I leard and now I would consider myself a 3 in java. The reason y I got into coding was simply I was bored after a while I saw the many things people did with minecraft code and I really wanted to so I found a tutorial for setting up forge and mcp and minecraft \r\nand thats where that happened.        \r\n\r\nSo ExtraALL adds a bunch of things into minecraft like different pickaxes and things of that nature my favorite thing about coding so far is that you are not limited to what is in place already you decide what is and isn't there.\r\n\r\nMac users download the tar.gz file\r\nand windows .zip  \r\n","google":"UA-40539128-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
